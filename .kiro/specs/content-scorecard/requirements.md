# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Scorecard is a local agentic prototype that provides AI-powered content evaluation against configurable guidelines. The application runs entirely locally without requiring external hosting or authentication, designed for single-user operation. It leverages LLM agents to score draft content across multiple metrics, providing detailed feedback and improvement suggestions to help users enhance their writing quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to input my draft content through a simple interface, so that I can easily submit my work for evaluation without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a text area for draft input
2. WHEN the user wants to upload a file THEN the system SHALL accept .md and .txt file formats
3. WHEN the user submits content THEN the system SHALL validate the input is not empty
4. IF the content exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL display a warning message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content evaluator, I want the system to score my draft against predefined metrics, so that I can receive objective feedback on multiple aspects of my writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user triggers scoring THEN the system SHALL evaluate content against all configured metrics
2. WHEN scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a score from 1-5 for each metric
3. WHEN scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL provide specific reasoning for each score
4. WHEN scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL provide improvement advice for each metric
5. IF scoring fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to see my results in an intuitive visual format, so that I can quickly understand my content's strengths and weaknesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show an overall aggregated score
2. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show a radar chart visualization by category
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show expandable sections for each metric with score and comments
4. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL calculate weighted averages based on metric importance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to export my evaluation results, so that I can save and share my feedback for future reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide a JSON export option
2. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide a Markdown report export option
3. WHEN export is triggered THEN the system SHALL save files to a local reports directory
4. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide download links or file location information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content evaluator, I want to customize evaluation guidelines, so that I can tailor the scoring criteria to my specific content requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load guidelines from a configurable YAML file
2. WHEN guidelines are loaded THEN the system SHALL support multiple categories with weighted importance
3. WHEN guidelines are loaded THEN each category SHALL contain multiple metrics with individual weights
4. IF guidelines file is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL use default guidelines and notify the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to store data locally without requiring authentication, so that I can use it immediately without setup complexity while keeping my content private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL require no login or authentication process
2. WHEN data is stored THEN all content and results SHALL be saved to local files only
3. WHEN using LLM services THEN the system SHALL make API calls as needed for content evaluation
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL not require any external database or hosting service

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible LLM configuration options, so that I can choose between local models and cloud APIs based on my preferences and resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support local LLM providers (Ollama, LM Studio)
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN it SHALL support OpenAI API with environment variable configuration
3. WHEN switching providers THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate configuration from config.toml
4. IF LLM connection fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test the system with sample content, so that I can understand how it works before using it with my own drafts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user wants to try examples THEN the system SHALL provide pre-loaded sample drafts
2. WHEN sample drafts are selected THEN the system SHALL populate the input area with example content
3. WHEN examples are scored THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the full evaluation workflow
4. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL cover different content types and quality levels

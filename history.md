# Content Scorecard Development History

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development progress, setup steps, bugs encountered, and their resolutions for the Content Scorecard application - an AI-powered content evaluation system.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Data Models
**Date:** Current Session  
**Task:** Task 1 - Set up project structure and core data models

#### Setup Steps Completed

1. **Directory Structure Creation**
   - Created `agents/` directory with `__init__.py` for content evaluation agents
   - Created `config/` directory with `__init__.py` for configuration management
   - Created `storage/` directory with `__init__.py` for data persistence
   - Created `tests/` directory with `__init__.py` for test files
   - All directories properly initialized as Python packages

2. **Core Data Models Implementation**
   - Implemented `Metric` class for evaluation metrics with validation
   - Implemented `MetricResult` class for individual metric evaluation results
   - Implemented `EvaluationResult` class for complete content evaluations
   - Implemented `LLMConfig` class for LLM provider configuration
   - Implemented `AppConfig` class for main application settings

#### Bugs and Issues Encountered

##### Issue #1: Pydantic Protected Namespace Warning
**Problem:** 
```
UserWarning: Field "model_name" has conflict with protected namespace "model_".
You may be able to resolve this warning by setting `model_config['protected_namespaces'] = ()`.
```

**Root Cause:** 
Pydantic v2 protects certain namespaces by default, including "model_", which conflicted with our `model_name` field in the `LLMConfig` class.

**Solution Applied:**
Added `model_config = {"protected_namespaces": ()}` to the `LLMConfig` class to disable protected namespace warnings.

**Before:**
```python
class LLMConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for LLM providers."""
    provider: Literal["openai", "ollama", "lmstudio"] = Field(...)
    model_name: str = Field(...)  # This caused the warning
```

**After:**
```python
class LLMConfig(BaseModel):
    """Configuration for LLM providers."""
    model_config = {"protected_namespaces": ()}  # Fix applied
    
    provider: Literal["openai", "ollama", "lmstudio"] = Field(...)
    model_name: str = Field(...)  # Warning resolved
```

**Status:** ✅ Resolved

##### Issue #2: IDE Autofix Applied
**Problem:** 
Kiro IDE automatically applied formatting/autofix to `config/models.py` after implementation.

**Impact:** 
File content was updated by the IDE's automatic formatting system.

**Resolution:** 
- Verified that the autofix maintained all functionality
- No breaking changes were introduced
- Code formatting was improved while preserving all logic

**Status:** ✅ Resolved - No action needed

#### Verification and Testing

**Test Implementation:**
- Created `test_models.py` to verify all data models work correctly
- Tested instantiation of all model classes
- Verified field validation and constraints
- Confirmed proper Pydantic behavior

**Test Results:**
```
✓ Metric model created: clarity
✓ MetricResult model created with score: 4
✓ EvaluationResult model created with overall score: 3.8
✓ LLMConfig model created for provider: openai
✓ AppConfig model created with reports dir: reports

✅ All data models are working correctly!
```

#### Requirements Satisfied

**Task 1 Requirements:**
- ✅ Create directory structure for agents, config, storage, and tests
- ✅ Implement Pydantic data models for Metric, MetricResult, and EvaluationResult
- ✅ Include fields for positive_examples and improvement_examples in MetricResult
- ✅ Create base configuration classes with type validation

**Spec Requirements Addressed:**
- ✅ Requirement 5.1: System loads guidelines from configurable YAML file (AppConfig.guidelines_path)
- ✅ Requirement 5.2: Support multiple categories with weighted importance (Metric.category, Metric.weight)
- ✅ Requirement 5.3: Each category contains multiple metrics with individual weights (Metric model structure)

#### Key Implementation Details

**Data Model Features:**
- Full type validation using Pydantic v2
- Comprehensive field descriptions for documentation
- Proper constraints (e.g., scores 1-5, weights 0.0-1.0)
- Default values where appropriate
- Support for metadata and extensibility

**Configuration Management:**
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama, LMStudio)
- Configurable file paths and directories
- Temperature and other LLM parameters
- Theme and UI customization options

## Next Steps

**Upcoming Tasks:**
- Task 2: Implement YAML guidelines loader and parser
- Task 3: Create LLM integration service
- Task 4: Build content evaluation engine
- Task 5: Implement scoring and aggregation logic

## Development Environment

**Python Version:** 3.12  
**Key Dependencies:** 
- Pydantic (for data validation)
- PyYAML (planned for guidelines loading)
- Various LLM client libraries (planned)

**IDE:** Kiro IDE with autofix/formatting enabled
